# backend_node_js
Backend project using Node.js
At this project, i used Nodemon for helping me out restart the server at dev mode(not production).
I used the following Js tools:
* Express for send/receive http requests at different routes and endpoints;
* Knex for communicating with MySql database;
* Passport for authenticating http requests;
* consign for loading different parts of the project and create middlewares for the project;
* body-parser for parsing http content (JSON at most);
* bcrypt for protect passwords;
